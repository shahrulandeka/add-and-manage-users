<h1>[Mini] Add and Manage Users with Linux Commands</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In this lab example, I run through how to add and manage users with Linux Commands. When managing authentication, I need to ensure that:
<br/>
- Not all users get access to the system, <br/>
- New users (those who are new to the organization or a group) are added to the system, and <Br/>
- Current users who change groups or leave the organization are deleted from the system.
<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>Bash Shell</b> 
- <b>Oracle VM Virtual Box</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Windows 10 Pro</b> (22H2)

<h2>Program walk-through:</h2>

<p align="center">
Launch the utility: <br/>
 For this example, a new employee with the username "researcher9" joins an organization. <br/>
 I will be adding him to the system, and managing his access during his tenure with the organization. <br/>
 First, I'll add him to the system and assign him to his primary group. <br/>
 Second, I'll make him the owner of a file related to a particular project. <br/>
 Third, I'll add him to a supplementary group. <br/>
 Lastly, I'll delete him from the system.

<br />
1. A new employee has joined the organization with the username "researcher9": <br/>
Type in "sudo useradd researcher9" to add him to the system. <br/>
Next, type in "sudo usermod -g research_team researcher9" to add him to his primary group.

<br />
<br />
2. researcher9 will take responsibility for project_r.txt: <br/>
 Now I must make him the owner of that file. <Br/>
 Currently, researcher2 is the owner of that file, so type in "sudo chown researcher9 project_r.txt" to change ownership.
